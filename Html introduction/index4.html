<!-- Instructions: -->

<!-- Ensure that the language attribute in the opening <html> tag is correctly spelled and appropriate for the document's content.
Enhance the viewport meta tag to ensure that it scales properly on mobile devices.
Review the <nav> section and correct any structural or syntactical errors. Make sure each list item is clickable, directing to a placeholder link (#).
Convert the non-semantic <div> that wraps the blog introduction into a more semantic HTML5 element.
In the form section:
Make sure each input has an associated <label>.
The email input seems to be missing a name attribute. Determine an appropriate value and add it.
Improve the form's layout for better readability and user experience. Consider using block-level elements to structure the content.
After making the above corrections, expand the document:
Add a <footer> section containing a copyright notice (e.g., "© 2023 My Personal Blog").
Add a <header> at the top of the body, containing a large blog title and a brief tagline.
Validate the revised HTML code using an online HTML validator to ensure all issues are resolved. -->
